# Student Activity Management Web


This website was designed and finished as an entrepreneurship project by our team(7 team members).  Our group took 5 months
to finish this project, and we has two versions, you can compare them through pictures. (For simplicity, I only upload the new project, but pictures have two verisons.) This project also should work with a mobile app, but for the sake of protecting the integrity of our results, I will not upload it. If you have interests, you can still run this website independently.

3. The value of this project:
	In short, as we all know, many students in colleage have only three things: studying, sleeping, eating. Especially science students. Why not go outside and play with another one? Two things: on one hand, they cannot find enough people to do what they like, such as football, basketball and so on. On the other hand, they cannot find where has an activity they really like. Especially in China, our students usually find activities from student union and communities. But their activities are often constrained by many things, such as group members' schedual, everyone's interests. Maybe one day you just want to play soccer, but other group members are busy. You cannot find anyone, and you also don't know how to find strangers to play soccer. In this situation, what you can do is giving it up and keeping on studing, sleeping and eating... Yes! It is what our project want to solve. In our website, you can put your interests and activities in time, and people and strangers who have interests will follow you. Ok, what I said is just a brief summary, our website can do lots of things, such as activity management, group members check in, activity grades management and so on.

4. What did I do?
	I have helped our leader to design the overall framework and functional details of the website. I was the only one front-end developer. And I designed and developed both two versions of website. As you can see, the website has more than 30 pages, and I developed the front-end pages of new version within one week by myself. Besides that, I also participated in some parts of back-end development(ex: school information part) and code testing.

5. Each part of website:
	(1) ActivityCreate
	(2) ActivityManagement
	(3) AllTables
	(4) Announce
	(5) ChangeSchInfo
	(6) ClubManagement
	(7) Count
	(8) GradeManagement
	(9) LoginPage
	(10) MainPage
	(11) OmiTables
	(12) StatisticalAnalysis

6. How to use this website?
	(1) I have uploaded the zip file including the whole project, and in order to help you notice the details of each part, I also uploaded subpages individually.  You can find them in the "SubProjects" file. Finally, do not forget to download the JQuery file, otherwise the JS code will not work well.
	(2) Maybe you should put the project in Myeclipse and Apache, as for the database, you should use MongoDB, and change the details of the file:"DBClientFactory.java" in "com.dao". But if you just want to see the web pages, just download "SubProjects" file and open it directly, for the pages in the "SubProjects" are uploaded without any JSP code.
